1. create an account on github.com for free.
2. check if you have git installed on your pc by
    opening cmd and typing:
            C:\> git
    if you get command undefined, then install git from:
        https://git-scm.com/download/

3. create a dir named Code
4. navigate to the Code dir with cmd and type:
        C:\...\Code\> git clone https://github.com/Interface0625/pong.git
6. open project with WebStorm : Code/pong
By now, you should have a fresh copy of pong that is on git hub.
Now you should use the built in cmd in webstorm.
If not open you can open it in lower left corner.

Check if you can commit:
1. Edit any file.
2. right click -> Git -> Commit File.
3. Write somthing in "Commit message" Textarea.
4. Press commit button.

By now you have edited the file and commited it to the local machine.
Next you hav to "push" the project to github.com by typing this command
while in the project directory:

git push origin master

This will ask for your credentials @github.com

If you get to this point that means that you have successfully:
Cloned a project from github.com
Modified it.
Commited the changes.
and Uploaded it to github.com

From now on. You should:
Commit after editing a file.
Push when you're happy with the changes and/or want to share your code.

Before begining your code session you should always sync your project w/ github
becouse I will push some changes to the project.

To sync:
git pull

To upload:
git push

set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Program Files\Git"
